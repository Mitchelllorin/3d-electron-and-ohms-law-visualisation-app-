Project: 3D Electrical Visualization App

Revolutionizing Electrical Education with Interactive, Atomic-Level Simulations

Hi, everyone!

I’m Mitchell, an electrical student with a vision for a tool that could transform how we learn and teach electrical principles. This open-source project aims to develop a 3D interactive app that visualizes:

The flow of electrons orbiting nuclei,

Their movement through circuits driven by voltage (current),

The effects of resistance, and

Key principles of Ohm's Law—all in an atomic-scale, interactive simulation.


Current Status

We already have:

1. A detailed outline of the app’s functionality and features.


2. A prototype concept in progress.



This app has the potential to benefit students, educators, and professionals alike by turning abstract electrical concepts into a tangible learning experience.

Looking for Contributors

To bring this idea to life, I’m seeking collaborators with expertise in:

3D Modeling and Animation: Building immersive atomic and circuit-based visualizations.

App Development: Creating an intuitive and interactive user experience.

Electrical Engineering and Education: Ensuring technical accuracy and educational relevance.


Fair Collaboration

I want to make it clear that while I currently don’t have funding, this project is about fairness and transparency. If we create a commercially viable product, all contributors will be compensated fairly for their work and contributions.

How You Can Help
